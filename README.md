# First-HTML-Scripts
## Winter 2020 - Spring 2020
Some of my very first few HTML scripts when I was learning in highschool that I look back on fondly. Very rudementary uses of colours, web images, and JavaScript integration.

Based on guidelines given in class (some topics are very random), but I was encouraged to use my imagination, research new functions and techniques, and add as much as I wanted, so the pages ended up being above and beyond what was neccessary.

My personal favorite is '24 and 25 Sentences.html'. At the time it felt like a huge accomplishment to have that much going on, and I was so proud of thinking to use the JavaScript ['Whale Translator'](<../First-JavaScript-Programs/6%20WhaleTranslator.js>) again.
